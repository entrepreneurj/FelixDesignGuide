\chapter{Introduction}
 The purpose of the Felix Design Guide is to provide a guide for Section Editors to follow while designing their pages for the paper. This should be put together by the Editor-in-Chief each year.
The Design Guide (DG) will explain the styles associated with different elements of the paper and how they should be used to complete the design for each page. If you have any questions, consult the Editor-in-Chief who should be able to give you the best solution for the problem.

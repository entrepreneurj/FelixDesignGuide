\chapter{Fonts}

Felix (2013-14) uses several font families, so how do you know what to use and when?

\section{Futura}

Futura is the paper's main sans-serif font, used for headlines and general titles. 

\begin{description}
	\item[Futura Bold] The bold weight is used for section titles, article headlines, drop caps, box titles and pull quotes.
	\item[Futura BoldCondensed] The condensed version of the bold weight should be rarely used. It is mainly used for news headlines to give contrast (especially in 'all caps').
	\item[Futura Medium] The medium weight is used for sub-headlines and in-article titles. 
\end{description}

\section{Warnock Pro}

Warnock Pro is the font family used for copy (article text). This is a serif font and is only used in main text (i.e. not headlines/title).

\begin{description}
	\item[Warnock Pro Regular] The regular weight is used for the bulk of the article text
	\item[Warnock Pro Bold] The bold weight is used for emphasis in articles, to highlight interview questions or to draw attention to an informative last paragraph (i.e. event/campaign information)
	\item[Warnock Pro Italic] The italic weight is used to show artist/event names, long stretches of quotations and de-emphasise intro text before an article.
\end{description}

\section{Jigsaw}
 Jigsaw is a font family that has been slightly carried over from the previous design. Generally not used.
